# ALGORITHM'S FUNCTIONING

This algorithm is quite simple, it creates an empty string, in which it will add random characters based on the options and the length chosen by the user.

# TEMPLATE STRUCTURE

The HTML page includes:

- input (where the password will be showed).
- copy button.
- form with a select for the password's length and four checkboxes to choose the characters to use.
- generate button.
- history button.

# FUNCTIONS

At now it has only three functions: it can generate random passwords, copy them to the clipboard and can also show the history of all generated passwords.

### PLEASE NOTE: IF YOU REFRESH THE PAGE, YOU WILL LOSE ALL YOUR PASSWORDS GENERATED SO FAR.
