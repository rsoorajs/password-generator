# HOW IT WORKS?

The algorithm is quite simple, it creates an empty string, in which it will add random characters based on the options and the length chosen by the user.

# WHAT FUNCTIONS DOES IT HAVE?

At now it has only three functions: generate the password, copy it to the clipboard and show the history of all generated passwords.

# WHERE'S THE CSS?!
